# IS Test Task

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

## Original task

Review the following technical problem. The solution should be delivered via a Git repository, JSFiddle, or a ZIP file.

The problem:

A movie theatre sells the three concession stand items listed below:

- Popcorn = \$3
- Snickers = \$4 (or five for the price of three)
- Soda = \$2

Implement a web application for the movie theatre that allows a user to add the above items to a shopping cart and calculates the total for the given collection of items. For example, the following basket should total up to \$23.

- 3x Popcorn
- 5x Snickers
- 1x Soda

Deliver your solution as a Javascript web application using a modern client-side framework such as Angular, Ember, Backbone, etc. Your solution should be able to run in Chrome.

Consider testability, documentation, and other good coding practices in your solution. Your application can run exclusively in the browser and doesn't need to have a server-side component.

Additional optional challenges:

1. Allow for adding new items at runtime without restarting/rebuilding/refreshing the application.
