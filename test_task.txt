Review the following technical problem. The solution should be delivered via a Git repository, JSFiddle, or a ZIP file.


The problem:


A movie theatre sells the three concession stand items listed below:

         Popcorn = $3 

         Snickers = $4 (or five for the price of three) 

         Soda = $2 


Implement a web application for the movie theatre that allows a user to add the above items to a shopping cart and calculates the total for the given collection of items. For example, the following basket should total up to $23.

         3x Popcorn 

         5x Snickers 

         1x Soda 


Deliver your solution as a Javascript web application using a modern client-side framework such as Angular, Ember, Backbone, etc. Your solution should be able to run in Chrome.


Consider testability, documentation, and other good coding practices in your solution. Your application can run exclusively in the browser and doesn뭪 need to have a server-side component.


Additional optional challenges:

1.       Allow for adding new items at runtime without restarting/rebuilding/refreshing the application.
